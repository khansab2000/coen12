FUNCTION		WORST CASE RUNTIME
createDataSet		O(1)
destroySet		O(1)
searchID		O(n)
insert			O(n)
deletion		O(n)

For App 2, I chose a hash table implementation, because we are searching frequently, and the expected runtime for a hash search is O(1), much better than the search of any other implementation.
